        <p className="contentTitle">About the Nakamoto Coefficient</p>
        <p className="content">
          The <b>Nakamoto Coefficient</b> measures how many independent entities are required to control a critical share of a blockchain network (typically 33% for Proof-of-Stake systems). The higher the number, the harder it is for any small group to censor transactions or halt the chain. (i.e. the higher the Nakamoto Coefficient, the better.)
          <br /><br />
          While the concept is simple, <b>calculating it accurately is not</b>.
          <br /><br />
          In practice, Nakamoto Coefficient calculations rely on imperfect, publicly available data. It is often impossible to determine with certainty whether multiple validators are operated by the same underlying party. Additional factors such as validator geography, cloud infrastructure concentration, and shared operational dependencies can further influence decentralization without being directly observable on-chain.

          Our Methodology for calculating the Nakamoto Coefficient
        </p>
        <div className="content">
          At Nakaflow, we calculate the Nakamoto Coefficient using the best available entity-level staking data. Instead of counting individual validator nodes in isolation, we aggregate stake by controlling entities, including:
          <ul>
          <li>Independent validator operators (e.g. Chainflow)</li>
          <li>Staking providers and pools (e.g. Lido)</li>
          <li>Other identifiable stake-controlling organizations</li>
          </ul>

          We then determine the minimum number of these entities required to reach the control threshold, based on their total staked share.

          Important Limitations
        </p>
        <p className="content">
          Nakaflow's Nakamoto Coefficient should be understood as a conservative, data-driven estimate, not an absolute truth. Where ownership or control relationships cannot be verified, we rely on transparent assumptions and verifiable public information. Nakaflow does not currently account for geographic concentration, cloud infrastructure dependencies, or governance-layer centralization, which may further affect a network's real-world decentralization.
          <br /><br />
          Our goal is not to claim perfect certainty but to provide the clearest, most defensible view of real-world decentralization using available data.

          Improving the Nakamoto Coefficient on Your Networks
        </p>
        <p className="content">
          Improving a blockchain's Nakamoto Coefficient means reducing the concentration of control among a small number of large entities. In Proof-of-Stake networks, this is primarily influenced by how and where tokens are staked.
          <br /><br />
          The most effective way to increase the Nakamoto Coefficient is to distribute stake across a larger number of independent validator operators, rather than concentrating it with the largest stake holders.

          Practical Ways to Improve the Nakamoto Coefficient
        </p>
        <div className="content">
          Token holders can directly influence network decentralization by adjusting their staking behavior. Two proven approaches are:

          <ol>
          <li><b>Stake with smaller, independent validators:</b> Use block explorers or staking dashboards to identify validator operators outside the top stake holders. Delegating stake to these operators helps reduce concentration and increases the number of entities required to reach control thresholds.</li>
          <li><b>Use Algorithmic or Distributed Stake Pools:</b> Some staking solutions automatically rebalance stake toward high-performing but smaller validators. These algorithmic stake pools are designed to optimize both performance and decentralization without requiring manual validator selection.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

        <p className="contentTitle">
          Why This Matters
        </p>
        <p className="content">
          A higher Nakamoto Coefficient makes a network more resilient to censorship, collusion, and operational failure. While protocol design plays a role, staking decisions made by token holders are a major driver of real-world decentralization.
          <br /><br />
          By consciously distributing stake, participants contribute to stronger, more decentralized blockchain networks.
